# 📧 Email Notifications When Sellers Are Logged Out

## ✅ **YES - Email Notifications Work Automatically!**

Your email notification system is designed to work **24/7 automatically**, even when sellers are:
- ❌ **Logged out** of the application
- ❌ **Browser closed** 
- ❌ **Not using the website**
- ❌ **Phone/computer turned off**
- ❌ **Away from their devices**

## 🔄 **How It Works Automatically**

### **1. Vercel Cron Job (Background Process)**
```json
{
  "crons": [
    {
      "path": "/api/notifications/send-reminders",
      "schedule": "0 */6 * * *"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Schedule**: Every 6 hours (12:00 AM, 6:00 AM, 12:00 PM, 6:00 PM)
**Location**: Runs on Vercel's servers (not on seller's device)
**Trigger**: Automatic - no user interaction needed

### **2. Automatic Process Flow**

```
🕐 Every 6 Hours:
├── Vercel Server calls /api/notifications/send-reminders
├── System checks database for sellers with pending receipts
├── For each seller with notifications enabled:
│   ├── Check if they have pending receipts
│   ├── Verify frequency setting (30s, 30m, 1h, off)
│   ├── Check if enough time passed since last email
│   └── Send email if conditions are met
└── Also auto-cancel unpaid orders older than 3 minutes
```

### **3. Seller Frequency Settings**

| Setting | Description | When Email Sent |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|
| **30s** | Every 30 seconds | If pending receipts exist |
| **30m** | Every 30 minutes | If pending receipts exist |
| **1h** | Every 1 hour | If pending receipts exist |
| **off** | No notifications | Never |

## 📧 **Email Content**

When a seller receives an email notification:

**Subject**: `🔔 X Pending Receipt(s) Awaiting Your Review`

**Content Includes**:
- Number of pending receipts
- Receipt details (amount, buyer, product)
- Direct link to seller dashboard
- Professional HTML design
- Frequency information

## 🎯 **Real-World Example**

**Scenario**: Seller Muhammad Afiq has notifications set to "30m"

1. **12:00 PM**: Cron job runs, finds 3 pending receipts for Muhammad
2. **12:00 PM**: Email sent to `mdafiq3256@gmail.com`
3. **12:30 PM**: Cron job runs again, finds same 3 receipts
4. **12:30 PM**: Email sent again (30m frequency allows this)
5. **1:00 PM**: Cron job runs, finds same 3 receipts
6. **1:00 PM**: Email sent again
7. **Continue every 6 hours** until receipts are approved

**Muhammad doesn't need to**:
- ❌ Be logged in
- ❌ Have browser open
- ❌ Be using the app
- ❌ Be at his computer

## 🔧 **Technical Details**

### **Database Queries**
```javascript
// Find sellers with notifications enabled
const sellers = await prisma.user.findMany({
  where: {
    userType: 'seller',
    reminderFrequency: { not: 'off' }
  }
});

// Check for pending receipts
const pendingReceipts = await prisma.receipt.findMany({
  where: {
    sellerId: seller.id,
    status: 'pending'
  }
});
```

### **Email Sending**
```javascript
await sendEmail({
  to: seller.email,
  subject: `🔔 ${receiptCount} Pending Receipt(s) Awaiting Your Review`,
  html: htmlContent,
  text: textContent
});
```

### **Frequency Tracking**
```javascript
// Track last email sent time
const lastEmailSent = new Map();
const timeSinceLastEmail = now - lastSent;
const frequencyMs = getFrequencyInMs(seller.reminderFrequency);
return timeSinceLastEmail >= frequencyMs;
```

## 🚀 **Production Benefits**
