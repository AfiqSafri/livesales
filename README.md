   - Navigate to **Security** > **2-Step Verification**
   - Click "Turn on 2-step verification" if not already enabled
   - Set up at least one verification method (Google prompt, phone number, or authenticator app)

2. **Generate App Password**
   - Go to **Security** > **App passwords**
   - Select "Mail" as the app
   - Click "Generate"
   - Copy the 16-character password (it will look like: `abcd efgh ijkl mnop`)

3. **Use in Environment**
   - Replace `your-app-password` with the generated app password
   - Keep this password secure and don't commit it to version control
   - The app password is different from your regular Gmail password
